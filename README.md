# Java Exercises Solutions_Chapter03 - Deitel & Deitel
This project contains my solutions to the exercises from the book "Java How to Program" by Deitel & Deitel. These implementations demonstrate fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java.
## OOP Concepts Implemented

* Encapsulation: Using private access modifiers for attributes and public methods to access them.
* Constructors: Implementation of default and parameterized constructors.
* Getter/setter methods: For controlled access to private attributes.
* Data validation: Verification of valid values before assigning them.
